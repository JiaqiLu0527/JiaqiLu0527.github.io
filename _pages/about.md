I am a postgraduate student at [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), majoring in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science([MFoCS](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science)). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications([BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/)).  I will be a postgraduate student at [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), majoring in [MRes AI and Machine Learning](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/pg-info/mres-ai-and-machine-learning/).  

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially complexity theory.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jan Pich](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0742/) and [Prof. Rahul Santhanam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/rahul.santhanam/), working on my master's dissertation on proof complexity and pseudorandomness. In Imperial College London, I will be advised by [Prof. Iddo Tzameret](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~itzamere/index.html), working on the project: Limitations on Learning Algorithms and Provability.
