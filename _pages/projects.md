Connection between Rudich's and Razborov's conjectures 
======
Supervisor: [Dr. Jan Pich](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0742/) and [Prof. Rahul Santhanam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/rahul.santhanam/)  
Keywords: proof complexity, pseudorandomness, natural proofs, and bounded arithmetic
* Study the standard assumptions for Rudich's conjecture
* Study the techniques of stretching pseudorandom bits in the non-deterministic setting
* Study the intuition of Rudich's conjecture and Razborov's conjecture
* Study the possible connection between Rudich's conjecture and Razborov's conjecture


Information-Theoretic Approximation of Large Markov Chains
======
Supervisor: [Prof. George Karakostas](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~gk/)  
Keywords: approximation algorithm, convex optimization, Markov chain, clustering
* Studied, both theoretically and experimentally, methods of MC reduction, formulated them as optimization problems, and then developed provably good algorithms for solving the latter
* Explored the connections of the MC reduction problem to Machine Learning
* Finished the problem formulation and modelling side and focused on the theoretical analysis of proposed solutions


Recursive Teaching Dimension Versus VC Dimension
======
Supervisor: [Prof. Xingwu Liu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xingwu)  
Keywords: combinatorics, computational learning theory, VC dimension
* Studied the quantitative relation between the recursive teaching dimension(RTD) and the well-known learning complexity measure VC dimension(VCD)
* Studied the Book Introductory Combinatorics by Richard A. Brualdi
